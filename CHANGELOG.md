Added cyphers for the `SyncLAPSPassword` edge, domain trusts, as well as a bug fix. If user input for setting a group, user, or computer contained parentheses or other special characters it would break cyphers. Additional filtering has been added for these inputs. Some of the command list ordering was also changed to be more user-friendly.
